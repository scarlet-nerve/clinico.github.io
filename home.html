					<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
					<label>Inception</label>
					<p>Even before the inaugural stone was laid on the foundations of Dr L H Hiranandani Hospital, in the first flush of the new millennium, everyone associated with it could see that it was a more sublime affair than mere brick and mortar.
					</p><p>And with very good reason. When a yet-to-be-born hospital, however swanky, however massive, aspires to mirror the long and illustrious career of a titan in the field, the usual concerns of hospital management and business blue-printing are the first to go out of the window. Not a single act of its coming into being stays mundane; everything is inevitably a question of honour. One chooses the nobler and brighter options over practical and gainful ones, choices that are worthy of the name it is founded on. 
					</p><p>And when it is a tribute to an iconic father by his almost equally accomplished sons, it even transcends the question of honour. It becomes an act of love.
					</p>
					
					
					
					<label>History</label>
					<p>
						Clinico, founded in honour of the legend, Padma Bhushan Dr Ramakrishna, came into existence in February 2004.
					</p><p>The challenge of the early days was enormous, to foster the fledgling hospital into an enduring symbol of healthcare in the country. We recognised early on, that to make a real and substantial contribution, one had to redefine the standards themselves, instead of doing more of the same. That set the tone of our endeavour and guided us every step of the way, luring us towards ambitious solutions, services, teamwork and quality that suited us.
					</p><p>	The results were quick to show. In 2007 we became the first hospital in Western India to receive the prestigious NABH Accreditation for Hospitals and Healthcare providers, an honour accorded to only eight hospitals in the country at the time. The IMC Ramakrishna Bajaj National Quality Award trophy, for excellence in healthcare, followed in 2008. In 2009, we were the proud recipients of the coveted International Asia Pacific Quality Award (The Malcolm Baldridge Award) as it is known outside in the United States.
					</p>
					
					<label>Today</label>
					<p>
						It is an established fact that at the heart of the Hiranandani mission, in any sector, is the passionate commitment to stay at par with global standards. Predictably, the theme reflects on nearly everything we undertake at the Hospital â€“ the first initiative of the Hiranandani Group in healthcare. From the simplest to the most complex surgical; procedures are performed at our hospital.  We are equipped with medical equipment purchased from the foremost vendors in the world.
